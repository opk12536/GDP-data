The dataset contains per capita GDP data for 187 countries from 1970 to 2022. Each row corresponds to a country, identified by its name and a unique serial number. The columns represent years, starting from 1970 and continuing through to 2022, with values indicating the per capita GDP for each country in that year. The GDP values are recorded as floating-point numbers, and while the dataset appears mostly complete, there are a few missing values in the later years. This dataset is useful for analyzing economic trends and comparing GDP growth across different countries over time.
